          Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on down to our museum, there’s plenty to
          see
          and do.
          You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel back in time and meet our
          resident Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits are designed to be accessible for interested minds, so make sure you
          come ready to learn and explore.
